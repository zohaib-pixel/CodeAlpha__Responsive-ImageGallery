Responsive ImageGallery Description
This project showcases a modern, fully responsive image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery features a clean grid layout that automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless viewing experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Users can explore images using Next/Previous navigation or by clicking thumbnails to open a lightbox view with smooth transitions. The gallery also includes hover effects, category filters (like Nature, City, People, Animals), and optional visual filters (Grayscale, Sepia) for creative customization.

The design emphasizes simplicity, performance, and accessibility, making it an excellent front-end project for portfolios or personal websites.
